  Hello!
  <br>
  Welcome to my World Studies project on the Proclamation of 1763.
  <br>
  You are about to enter a room where you will be able to learn about the Proclamation, like in a museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Controls:
  <br>
  <br>
  W - move forward
  <br>
  S - move backward
  <br>
  a - move left
  <br>
  d - move right
  <br>
  <br>
  Use the mouse to look around. You move relative to the direction you are looking.
  <br>
  Enjoy!
  <br>
